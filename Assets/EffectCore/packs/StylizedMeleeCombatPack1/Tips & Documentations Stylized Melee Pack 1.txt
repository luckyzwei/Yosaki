Tips and tutorials: Stylized Melee Combat Pack#1

How to make new colored effects

1. Copy the template folder (StylizedMeleeCombatPack#1/prefabs/"what you want to copy"/Template"what you want to copy")
2. Drag out the prefab into the sceneview
3. Open up the tabs in particleColorChanger script and start changing the color values.
4. Use apply check to apply color or turn on the keep_apply changes.
5. Save prefab

Optimization tips:
Disabling components is the way to go, all particles can be reduced in emittion if needed. 
(Inside the Particle System, Emission, lower the count in burst or time, spawns less particle).

Glow clipping through environment?
If your effects are clipping to much try to change the material defaultGlow_additive to Mobile-Particle-Add-ZTestAlways. These will render the effects above environment regardless.
I recommend using the Mobile-Particle-Add-ZTestAlways shader if you don't have any cellings or walls that might obstruct the view.

The webdemo included a optimized glow filter that can be downloaded free by unity standrad assets
1. Rightclick in project window, import package/Effects
2. Drag and drop the Optimized Bloom on your camera and it should be activated

Custom Shaders
The Mobile-Particle-Add-ZtestAlways and Mobile-Particle-AlphaBlend-ZTestAlways shaders are just copies of the unity mobile shaders Mobile Particle Additive/AlphaBlended but
has the Ztest set to Always that should work on LWRP and HWRP.

v1.2~
Updated volumetric slash effects for more variation

v1.5
Updated hiearchy for material sharing between packs

PS: I apolgize for having DestroyMe Scripts on the effects, this so I can test the effects.
The unity scene might lag if you have to many effects with the colorchange script keep_apply feature applied.
